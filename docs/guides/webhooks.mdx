### Webhooks

Use Paystack webhooks to receive reliable payment notifications on your backend. Verify events using your secret key.

#### Steps

- Expose a public HTTPS endpoint (e.g., `/webhooks/paystack`).
- Verify the `x-paystack-signature` header matches the body HMAC using your secret key.
- Process events like `charge.success`, `transfer.success`, etc.

#### Example (Dart backend pseudocode)

```dart
// verify hmac and parse event
// switch(event.type) { case 'charge.success': ... }
```

Always reconcile with `verifyTransaction(reference)` as a source of truth.
