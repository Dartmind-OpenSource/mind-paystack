# MindPaystack

**The Dart-First Paystack SDK**

Built from the ground up for Dart and Flutter developers, MindPaystack delivers a production-ready payment integration with clean architecture, type safety, and dependency injection out of the box.

## Why Dart-First Matters

MindPaystack isn't just another API wrapperâ€”it's architected specifically for the **Dart ecosystem** and its principles:

- **Pure Dart Core** â†’ Framework-agnostic foundation that works everywhere Dart runs
- **Flutter-Native** â†’ Dedicated Flutter layer with UI components and platform integrations  
- **Pub.dev Ready** â†’ Follows Dart package conventions and best practices
- **Null Safety** â†’ Built with sound null safety from day one
- **Async/Await Native** â†’ Leverages Dart's async model for clean, readable code

---

## Architecture: Dart Ecosystem at its Best

MindPaystack embraces the **Dart way** of building scalable applications:

### **Modular Package Design**
- **`mind_paystack`** â†’ Pure Dart core for universal compatibility
- **`mind_paystack_flutter`** â†’ Flutter-specific widgets and integrations (Coming Soon)
- **Future packages** â†’ Planned Web, Server, and CLI variants

### **Clean Architecture Pattern**
```dart
// Singleton pattern with dependency injection
await MindPaystack.initialize(PaystackConfig(
  publicKey: 'pk_test_your_key',
  secretKey: 'sk_test_your_key',
));

// Service-oriented access
final sdk = MindPaystack.instance;
final transaction = await sdk.transaction.initialize(request);
final verification = await sdk.transaction.verify(reference);
```

### **Injectable & GetIt Integration**
Built with [`injectable`](https://pub.dev/packages/injectable) for seamless dependency injection:
```dart
@injectable
class TransactionService implements ITransactionService {
  // Fully testable and mockable services
}
```

---

## Dart-Centric Developer Experience

### **Strongly Typed Everything**
```dart
// No dynamic types - full IDE support
final TransactionInitialization result = await sdk.transaction.initialize(
  InitializeTransactionOptions(
    email: 'user@example.com',
    amount: Money.fromCents(50000, Currency.ngn),
  ),
);
```

### **Test-First Design**
Built with Dart testing patterns in mind:
```dart
// Easy to mock with mocktail/mockito
final mockService = MockTransactionService();
when(() => mockService.initialize(any())).thenAnswer((_) async => result);
```

### **Freezed & Code Generation**
Leverages Dart's powerful code generation:
- **Freezed** for immutable data classes
- **Json Serialization** for API models
- **Injectable** for dependency injection setup

## Built for Dart Developers, By Dart Developers

**Enterprise-Ready Features:**
- **Dio HTTP Client** â†’ Interceptors, retries, and request/response logging
- **Logger Integration** â†’ Structured logging with configurable levels
- **Exception Hierarchy** â†’ `MindException` with detailed error categorization
- **Environment Config** â†’ Support for `.env` files and environment variables
- **Value Objects** â†’ `Money`, `Currency` types for financial safety

**Dart Ecosystem Integration:**
- **Very Good Analysis** â†’ Strict linting rules for code quality
- **Mason Templates** â†’ Scaffolding support (coming soon)
- **Flutter Dev Tools** â†’ Network inspection and debugging support

## When to Choose MindPaystack

**âœ… Perfect For:**
- **Flutter Apps** â†’ Native mobile payment experiences
- **Dart Backend** â†’ Server-side payment processing and webhooks
- **Full-Stack Dart** â†’ Shared payment logic across client and server
- **Enterprise Apps** â†’ Type-safe, testable, maintainable payment integrations

**ðŸ’¡ Why It Stands Out:**
Unlike generic HTTP clients or thin API wrappers, MindPaystack is built specifically for how **Dart and Flutter developers work**. It follows Dart conventions, embraces the type system, and integrates seamlessly with the broader Dart ecosystem.

Whether you're building a **Flutter fintech app**, a **Dart microservice**, or a **full-stack Dart application**, MindPaystack provides the foundation you need to handle payments reliably and maintainably.
