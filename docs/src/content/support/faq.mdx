### FAQ

#### Do I need both public and secret keys in Flutter?
Prefer using only the public key on the client and delegate secret‑key operations to your backend.

#### Are amounts in Naira?
Use the lowest denomination (kobo for NGN). 100000 = ₦1,000.00

#### How do I verify payments?
Always verify via `verifyTransaction(reference)` on your backend.
