### Testing with Mock APIs

For integration tests, substitute the HTTP client with a mock or point to a test gateway.

#### Tips

- Use `Environment.test` and test keys
- Stub network via `dio` interceptors in your tests
- Assert that services throw `MindException` with the right `category` and `code`
